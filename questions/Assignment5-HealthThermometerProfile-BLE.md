3. What is the peak current of an advertisement? 
   Answer:  27.95mA

4. Provide screen shot showing the connection interval settings. Do they match the values you set in your slave(server) code or the master's(client) values?. The connection interval matches with the client.

5. What is the average current between connection intervals?
   Answer: 0.9uA

6. If possible, provide screen shot verifying the slave latency matches what was reported when you logged the values from event = gecko_evt_le_connection_parameters_id.

8. What is the peak current of a data transmission when the phone is connected and placed approximately 20 feet away from the Blue Gecko? 
   Answer: 23.54mA
